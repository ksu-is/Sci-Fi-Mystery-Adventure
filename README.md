# Sci-Fi-Mystery-Adventure
This Sci-Fi Mystery Adventure Game allows users to play a simple, yet fun adventure-style game. Users will be met with decisions along the way, and the choices that are made in the game determine the final ending. This game is entirely text-based, and it is programmed using Python. 

Anyone is welcome to play this game, and it is appropriate for all age groups.

I am making this game for my Application Development class project, and there will not be any changes after the project is completed. I will also not be taking any contributions, as this is a solo project.

Please read the LICENSE to understand more about using this particular code. 

I hope you enjoy playing and thank you for checking out my code.
